# PageRank-Based Recommendation Application for "Trapezna"

## Project Overview

This project implements a recommendation system for the "Trapezna," based on the PageRank algorithm. The system helps users discover dishes tailored to their preferences by analyzing user sessions and connections between the ingredients in various dishes. Additionally, the application offers a visualization feature to explore these connections as a graph.

## Features

1. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Analyzes user choices during food orders.
   - Builds connections between user sessions and dish ingredients.
   - Recommends dishes that contain the user's preferred products.

2. **Graph Visualization:**
   - Displays the connections between user sessions and the dishes' ingredients as an interactive graph.

3. **Graph Logic**
   1. Graph Management
      - Save Graph (save_graph): Saves the graph to a JSON file for persistence.
      - Load Graph (load_graph): Loads a graph from a JSON file, creating an empty file if one doesnâ€™t exist.
      - Add Session (add_session): Adds a session of products to the graph.
   2. Menu Processing
      - Structure Menu (structure_menu): Transforms a nested dictionary of dishes and products into a flat, usable structure.
      - Dishes to Products (dishes_to_products): Extracts all products used in the selected dishes.
   3. Power Calculation
      - Calculate Product Power (calculate_products_power): Computes the power of each product based on its frequency across sessions (PageRank-inspired logic).
      - Calculate Dish Power (calculate_dishes_power): Aggregates product powers to compute the power of dishes.
   4. Ranking and Categorization
      - Sort Dishes (sort_dishes): Ranks dishes by their power in descending order.
      - Divide Dishes by Type (divide_dishes_by_type): Groups dishes into categories based on their type.

     

## How It Works

1. **Session Analysis:**
   - Tracks user sessions to identify preferences based on ordered dishes.
2. **Ingredient Mapping:**
   - Maps dishes to their ingredients to establish a network of connections.
3. **PageRank Algorithm:**
   - Applies the PageRank algorithm to prioritize dishes containing popular or user-favored ingredients.
4. **Recommendations:**
   - Generates a ranked list of recommended dishes for the user.

## Principles of Discrete Mathematics
1. **Graph Theory**
   - Nodes (products) and edges (session relationships) form the core of the analysis.
2. **Node Weighting**
   - Importance is derived from connections, akin to PageRank.
3. **Ranking Algorithms**
   - Items are sorted by their computed weight or power.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Graph Storage and Manipulation**
   - Functions for saving, loading, and updating graphs.
2. **PageRank Logic**
   - Calculating the "importance" of nodes (products).
3. **Aggregating node importance to evaluate dish relevance**
   - Ranking and Categorization: Sorting and grouping dishes by importance and type.

## Split Tasks
1. **UI**
   - Nazar took over the implementation of the interface.
2. **PageRank**
   - How to implement algorithms for converting dishes into products and calculating ranks - distributed by Iya and Oleksiy.
3. **Graph**
   - creation of a popularity graph and implementation of the output - Maria and Daria.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Graph Libraries:** graphviz (for graph visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dark-neonus/trapezna-recomendations.git
   cd trapezna-recomendations
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ### Install the Necesarry Library: graphviz
   ```bash
   pip install graphviz
   ```
   #### Instalation steps:
   ##### Windows

   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Browse and order dishes from "Trapezna."
3. For the next time view personalized dish recommendations based on your preferences.
4. Explore the graph visualization to understand ingredient connections.

## Feedback 
   - Our assistant Anton - has been helping us throughout the whole work and he always answered our questions. He offered valuable advice on structuring project, splitting tasks and realization of PageRank algorithm. The assistant offered suggestions to enhance the documentation and made sure all project requirements were addressed.
